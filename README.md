SHA-2-Hash-Generator
====================

Generates SHA1/2 hashes for a given input. It has SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 support as well as PBKDF2 support (1-100,000 rounds). 

This is a C#.NET Forms-based application that is used to quickly hash strings using SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512 using built-in .NET cryptographic functions (plus helper library from Josip Medved <jmedved@jmedved.com>).
